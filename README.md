```bash
# Download the killdeps script
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/burakboz/killdeps/master/bin/killdeps" -OutFile "killdeps"

# Check if the ~/bin directory exists, create it if not
If(!(Test-Path "$env:USERPROFILE\bin"))
{
    New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\bin"
}

# Move the downloaded script to the ~/bin directory
Move-Item -Path .\killdeps -Destination "$env:USERPROFILE\bin"

# Create a batch file to run the killdeps script with PHP
Set-Content -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\bin\killdeps.bat" -Value "php %USERPROFILE%\bin\killdeps %*"

# Add the ~/bin directory to the system PATH
$env:Path += ";$env:USERPROFILE\bin"

### Installation on Linux / macOS using `composer`

To install on Linux or macOS, open your terminal and execute the following command:

```bash
composer global require burakboz/killdeps
```

To add the `~/.composer/vendor/bin` directory to your system's PATH, modify your shell profile file (e.g., `~/.bashrc`, `~/.bash_profile`, or `~/.zshrc`) and add this line:

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin"
```

Afterwards, run `source ~/.bashrc` (or the appropriate profile file for your shell) to update your current session.

### Installation on Linux / macOS without composer

```bash
cd ~;(wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/burakboz/killdeps/master/bin/killdeps -O killdeps || curl -LJO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/burakboz/killdeps/master/bin/killdeps) && chmod +x killdeps && (mv killdeps /usr/local/bin/killdeps || sudo mv killdeps /usr/local/bin/killdeps)
```

### Uninstallation on Linux / macOS

```bash
(rm -f /usr/local/bin/killdeps || sudo rm -f /usr/local/bin/killdeps)
```

## Usage

To execute **killdeps**, navigate to the directory you wish to clean and type:

```bash
killdeps .
```

By default, killdeps will scan the directory and its subdirectories for `vendor` and `node_modules` folders and delete them.


## Examples

```bash
killdeps --help
# Show help

killdeps . 
# Deletes vendor and node_modules folders in the current directory

killdeps D:
# Deletes vendor and node_modules folders in the D: drive

killdeps --dry-run .
# Displays which folders would be deleted and the amount of space that could be reclaimed

killdeps --only-locked .
# If a lock file exists along with composer.json or package.json file, delete the associated package folder.

killdeps --only-locked --dry-run .
# Show locked package folders and reclaimable space

php killdeps
# Run directly with php interpreter
```
